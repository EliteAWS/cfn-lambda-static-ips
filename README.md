# cfn-lambda-static-ips


This CloudFormation template creates a VPC which can run your Lambda functions behind 1 or 2 Elastic IP addresses bound to NAT Gateways. This allows you to present static, whitelist-able IPv4s to external systems, while still operating fully elastic and autoscaling serverless architectures.
